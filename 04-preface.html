<h1>What we propose for 2014</h1>

<p>- The info about the tutorial that we've already worked out (webcast)&nbsp;<em>Scott would call in on a phone and have his computer logged in to&nbsp;the Internet and either show a slide deck or do some live screen sharing for&nbsp;demos. We would not be seeing Scott. We would have the audio/visual recorded&nbsp;via the ON24 webcasting platform we use.</em></p>

<p>- Tutorial for Strata West 2014 and a tutorial or session at Fluent 2014, and OSCON&nbsp;with us paying transportation costs</p>

<p>- A 2-5 hr video, 30% royalties</p>
